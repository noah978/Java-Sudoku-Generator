### HOW TO PLAY:

    The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.

    The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. 
    Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

    The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, or horizontal nine-square line across.
    All within the larger square, must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.

    Every puzzle has just one correct solution, which you should be able to deduce with only logic.
