### HOW TO PLAY:

    The classic Sudoku involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine sections, each with nine squares.

    The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. 
    Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

    The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, or horizontal nine-square line across.
    All within the larger square, must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.

    Every puzzle has just one correct solution, which you should be able to deduce with only logic.
    
    To generate a new sudoku, hit the space bar.
    To fill in a cell, left-click on it and use the desired number on your keyboard.
    If there is a direct conflict with the rules, the number will appear red, otherwise it will be blue.
    
    To "guess" a number for a cell, right-click on it, and then use the desired number on your keyboard.
    Left-clicking on a cell with guesses will clear all guesses and allow you to input the desired number as normal.
    You can right-click on a cell with guesses and remove the desired guess by using the corresponding number key.
